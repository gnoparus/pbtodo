## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- PocketBase (download from [pocketbase.io](https://pocketbase.io/docs/))

### Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pbtodo
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up PocketBase Server**
   ```bash
   # Download and extract PocketBase to ./pocketbase/
   cd pocketbase
   
   # Run migrations to set up database schema
   ./pocketbase migrate up
   
   # Start the server
   ./pocketbase serve
   ```
   
   - The migrations will automatically create the `todos` collection with proper schema and API rules
   - Visit `http://localhost:8090/_/` to access the admin dashboard (optional)
   - See `pocketbase/README.md` for detailed setup instructions

3. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Database Migrations

PocketBase uses JavaScript migrations to manage database schema:

```bash
cd pocketbase

# Apply pending migrations
./pocketbase migrate up

# Revert last migration
./pocketbase migrate down

# Create a new migration
./pocketbase migrate create "migration_name"

# View migration history
./pocketbase migrate collections
```

Key migrations:
- `007_add_todos_permissions.js` - Creates todos collection with:
  - Schema: title, description, completed, priority, user, created, updated
  - API Rules: Users can only access their own todos
  - Automatic user field population for authenticated requests

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage using Vitest and React Testing Library.

**Test Structure:**
```

npm run test:integration

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Coverage:**

  - Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - Responsive design testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)

**Before Running Unit/Integration Tests:**
1. Start PocketBase server: `cd pocketbase && ./pocketbase serve`
2. Migrations are applied automatically on server start
3. Test users are created automatically during test setup

**Before Running E2E Tests:**
1. Start PocketBase server: `cd pocketbase && ./pocketbase serve`
2. Start frontend dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
4. See [e2e/README.md](e2e/README.md) for detailed E2E testing guide

### API Integration

The frontend connects to PocketBase through a service layer:

```typescript
// Authentication
api.auth.login(email, password)
api.auth.register(email, password, name)
api.auth.logout()

// Todo operations
api.todos.getAll()
api.todos.create(data)
api.todos.update(id, data)
api.todos.delete(id)
```

### Data Models

#### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
  name: string
  avatar?: string
  created: string
  updated: string
}
```

#### Todo
```typescript
interface Todo {
  id: string
  title: string
  description?: string
  completed: boolean
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  user: string
  created: string
  updated: string
}
```

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `frontend/dist` folder to your hosting platform

3. Configure environment variables:
   - `VITE_POCKETBASE_URL`: Your PocketBase server URL

### Backend (PocketBase)

1. Upload the `pocketbase` directory to your server
2. Ensure the executable has proper permissions
3. Configure firewall rules for port 8090
4. Use a reverse proxy (nginx) for HTTPS

## Security

**Access Control:**
- All PocketBase collections have API rules configured via migrations
- Users can only access their own todos (`user = @request.auth.id`)
- Authentication required for all todo operations
- User field is automatically populated from authenticated session

**Data Protection:**
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt by PocketBase
- JWT tokens for session management
- CORS configured for production domains
- Input validation on both frontend and backend
- SQL injection protection built into PocketBase

**API Rules (todos collection):**
```javascript
listRule:   "@request.auth.id != '' && user = @request.auth.id"
viewRule:   "@request.auth.id != '' && user = @request.auth.id"
createRule: "@request.auth.id != ''"
updateRule: "@request.auth.id != '' && user = @request.auth.id"
deleteRule: "@request.auth.id != '' && user = @request.auth.id"
```
