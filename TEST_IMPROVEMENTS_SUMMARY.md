## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1.1: TodoContext Unit Tests [COMPLETED]

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Commit:** `4103986`  
**Date:** 2024  
**Test File:** `frontend/src/tests/TodoContext.test.tsx`

**Achievements:**
- ✅ Rewrote 100% of skipped TodoContext tests
- ✅ **32 tests passing** (previously 0% - all skipped)
- ✅ Complete coverage of all CRUD operations
- ✅ Test loading states, error handling, state updates
- ✅ Test concurrent operations and edge cases
- ✅ Test usage outside provider (error handling)
- ✅ Test callback stability with useCallback

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- Provider initialization and state management
- `loadTodos()` - success, failure, loading, error clearing
- `createTodo()` - with all fields, defaults, state updates, errors
- `updateTodo()` - success, failure, maintaining order
- `toggleTodoComplete()` - success, failure, state updates
- `deleteTodo()` - success, failure, correct removal
- `clearError()` - error state management
- Concurrent operations (multiple simultaneous calls)
- Error edge cases (non-Error exceptions, network timeouts)
- Callback reference stability (useCallback verification)

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Used test component pattern to properly test context logic
- Used `@testing-library/user-event` for proper `act()` handling
- Intentional error throwing in tests to verify error handling
- Comprehensive coverage of async state transitions

**Impact:**
- **Critical gap closed:** TodoContext now has complete test coverage
- No more skipped tests in the codebase
- Established pattern for testing React contexts in this project

### ✅ Phase 1.2: Token Refresh & Session Expiry Tests [COMPLETED]

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Commit:** `7195456`  
**Date:** 2024  
**Test File:** `frontend/src/tests/token-refresh.test.tsx`

**Achievements:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive token refresh test suite
- ✅ **20 tests passing** (new test file)
- ✅ Complete coverage of `refreshAuth()` functionality
- ✅ Test automatic session expiry detection
- ✅ Test refresh failure handling (triggers logout)
- ✅ Test concurrent refresh scenarios
- ✅ Test session persistence and recovery

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- `refreshAuth()` - success, loading states, user updates
- Token refresh failure handling - logout, error messages
- Session expiry detection on component mount
- Concurrent refresh requests (no deduplication documented)
- Session persistence across operations
- Error recovery and retry scenarios
- Edge cases:
  - Network timeouts
  - 401 Unauthorized responses
  - Non-Error exceptions
  - `getCurrentUser()` returning null

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Tests adapted to actual AuthContext behavior where `logout()` clears errors
- This is correct UX: after logout, user shouldn't see stale error messages
- Tests verify that logout is called on refresh failure (session cleanup)
- Console error spy used for tests that intentionally log errors

**Impact:**
- Token refresh behavior now has comprehensive test coverage
- Session expiry scenarios are verified
- Documented that concurrent refreshes are not deduplicated (potential future enhancement)

### ✅ Phase 1.3: Optimistic Updates Tests [COMPLETED]

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Commit:** `ea3fb46`  
**Date:** 2024  
**Test File:** `frontend/src/tests/optimistic-updates.test.tsx`

**Achievements:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive optimistic updates test suite
- ✅ **13 tests passing** (new test file)
- ✅ Complete coverage of current non-optimistic behavior
- ✅ **9 tests skipped** - serving as specification for future optimistic implementation
- ✅ Test create/toggle/delete operations under network delays
- ✅ Test error handling and state consistency
- ✅ Test concurrent operation handling
- ✅ Test edge cases (slow network, server data differences)

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- **Current Non-Optimistic Behavior:**
  - Create todo: loading state, API-first updates, error handling
  - Toggle complete: loading state, delayed UI updates, failure scenarios
  - Delete todo: loading state, removal after API confirmation
  - User experience: loading indicators, error messages, concurrent operations
  - Edge cases: slow network, server data differences, concurrent operations
- **Future Optimistic Behavior (Skipped Tests):**
  - Immediate UI updates before API completes
  - Rollback on API failure
  - Multiple optimistic updates handling
  - Performance (non-blocking UI during updates)

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Tests document CURRENT behavior: operations are NOT optimistic
- Wrapped context methods in try-catch to handle thrown errors cleanly
- Skipped tests serve as specification for future optimistic update implementation
- Tests verify that current implementation waits for API before updating UI

**Critical Gap Identified:**
- **TodoContext does NOT implement optimistic updates**
- Current behavior: UI updates only AFTER API completes
- Expected behavior (documented in skipped tests): immediate UI updates with rollback on failure
- This is a UX gap but tests document both current and desired behavior

**Impact:**
- Current non-optimistic behavior is fully tested and verified
- Created specification for future optimistic update implementation
- Tests will serve as regression suite when optimistic updates are added

### ✅ Phase 1.4: Network Resilience Tests [COMPLETED]

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Commit:** `a4982a0`  
**Date:** 2024  
**Test File:** `frontend/src/tests/network-resilience.test.tsx`

**Achievements:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive network resilience test suite
- ✅ **24 tests passing** (new test file)
- ✅ Complete coverage of current error handling behavior
- ✅ **12 tests skipped** - serving as specification for future resilience features
- ✅ Test timeout handling (slow/hanging requests)
- ✅ Test various network error scenarios
- ✅ Test HTTP error status codes (429, 500, 502, 503, 504)
- ✅ Test concurrent request handling and race conditions
- ✅ Test error recovery patterns

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- **Current Behavior:**
  - Timeout handling: extremely slow API responses, requests that never resolve
  - Network errors: connection failures, DNS resolution, ETIMEDOUT, ECONNREFUSED
  - HTTP error codes: 429 (rate limit), 500, 502, 503, 504
  - Intermittent issues: flaky network, partial data transfer failures
  - Concurrent requests: multiple simultaneous operations, request racing
  - Error recovery: manual retry, persistent error state
  - Large data: 1000+ items, empty responses
  - Edge cases: AbortError, malformed JSON, CORS, SSL/TLS, unexpected responses
- **Future Resilience Features (Skipped Tests):**
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Request timeout implementation
  - Request cancellation on unmount/new request
  - Rate limiting with Retry-After header
  - Offline detection and operation queue

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Tests document CURRENT behavior: no automatic retry or timeout mechanisms
- Tests verify error messages are passed through to user
- Concurrent requests are NOT queued - all fire simultaneously
- No request cancellation on component unmount
- No client-side rate limiting

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- **No automatic retry mechanism** for failed requests
- **No request timeout** - requests can hang indefinitely
- **No request cancellation** when component unmounts
- **No exponential backoff** for transient errors
- **No offline detection** or operation queuing
- **No rate limiting** to prevent overwhelming the API

**Impact:**
- Current error handling behavior is fully tested and verified
- Created specification for future resilience features (retry, timeout, cancellation)
- Tests will serve as regression suite when resilience features are added
- Documented 6 major gaps in network resilience

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Testing React Contexts:** Use test component pattern with `onRender` callback for direct context testing
2. **Act Warnings:** Always use `userEvent` from `@testing-library/user-event` to avoid act() warnings
3. **Error Testing:** Intentional error throwing in tests is expected; verify they're properly caught
4. **Async State:** Use `waitFor` for all async state transitions, even for loading states
5. **Logout Clears Errors:** AuthContext's logout clears error state - this is correct UX
6. **Error Handling in Tests:** Wrap context methods that throw in try-catch to avoid unhandled errors
7. **Skipped Tests as Specs:** Use `describe.skip` with detailed tests to document desired future behavior
8. **Document Current Behavior First:** Test actual behavior before specifying desired behavior
9. **Network Resilience:** Testing error scenarios reveals missing retry/timeout/cancellation features

### Process Insights
1. **Incremental Commits:** Committing after each phase keeps progress trackable
2. **Test-Driven:** Writing tests reveals implementation edge cases and gaps
3. **Documentation First:** Creating the implementation plan helped prioritize work
4. **Console Spies:** Use `vi.spyOn(console, 'error')` for tests that intentionally log errors
5. **Testing Reveals Gaps:** Optimistic update tests identified that feature is not implemented
6. **Tests as Documentation:** Skipped tests document expected behavior for future implementation
